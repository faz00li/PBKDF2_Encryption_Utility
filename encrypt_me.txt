This PBKDF2 encryption utility supports the following three symmetric encryption standards: 3DES, AES128, and AES256. The utility also supports two hashing algorithms: SHA256 and SHA512. To configure the utility enter 1) the path to the file you wish to encrypt 2) specify the hash type 3) specify the encryption standard 4) a password from which to the derive master key and 5) the number of iterations for PBKDF2
