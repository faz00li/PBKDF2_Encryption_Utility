* encrypt actual file

* add through file path


To consider:

validate params:

master keys PBKDF2
	* dkLen 
		Due to a flaw in the PBKDF2 design, you should not request more bytes than the prf can output. For instance, dkLen should not exceed 20 bytes in combination with HMAC-SHA1.
	* salt
		It is recommended to use at least 16 bytes.

Get more keys:
key1 = keys[:32]
key2 = keys[32:]
